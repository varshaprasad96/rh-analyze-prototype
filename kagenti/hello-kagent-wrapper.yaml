# Kagenti Integration for kagent.dev Agent
#
# ⚠️ NOTE: This approach has significant limitations!
# See README.md "Known Limitations" section for details.
#
# RECOMMENDED ALTERNATIVES:
# 1. Use kagent-ui for kagent.dev agents (native support)
# 2. Use MLflow ResponsesAgent with A2A wrapper for kagenti
#
# ---
# The core problem is that kagenti-ui requires:
# - agent.kagenti.dev resources with their own running pods
# - AgentCard that syncs from an Agent in "Ready" state
#
# You cannot simply create a wrapper that reuses kagent.dev pods.
# ---

# If you still want to try the wrapper approach, here's the pattern:
# (This will create a DUPLICATE pod running the same agent)

# Service Alias (port 8000 -> 8080)
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: hello-kagent-svc
  namespace: NAMESPACE_PLACEHOLDER
  labels:
    app: kagent
    kagent: hello-kagent
    kagenti.io/type: agent
spec:
  selector:
    app: kagent
    kagent: hello-kagent
  ports:

# BETTER APPROACH: MLflow ResponsesAgent + kagenti
#
# Instead of trying to wrap kagent.dev, build a dedicated agent:
# 1. Create MLflow ResponsesAgent with Llama Stack
# 2. Add A2A protocol wrapper (FastAPI)
# 3. Deploy as agent.kagenti.dev
